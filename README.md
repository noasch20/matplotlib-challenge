Module 5 Plotting Challenge
This analysis explores the effects of various drug regimens on tumor volume in mice. The dataset includes 248 unique mice (50.4% Male, 49.6% Female).
Insights included studies on average tumor volume, as well as final tumor volume.
Furthermore, the effect of Capomulin specifically was highlighted, with insights on a single case study and other possible biological factors.
This study provides insight into drug efficacy, time-based tumor progression, and correlations with biological factors.
